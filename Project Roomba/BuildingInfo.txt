BUILDING INFO:
The entire building (input) is in a single file with subfolders consisting of floors. Each floor folder contains text files representing
the information gathered when scanning each room.

Room Name Formatting: f/b#r###.txt
	"f/b#" denotes if it is a floor (increasing from 1 while ascending) or a basement (increasing from 1 while descending).
	"r###" denotes room. The first digit represents the "row" of the floor/building using the top-most row as 1. The two following
		digits represent the "column" of the room in the floor using 10 as an arbitrary center.

	EXAMPLE: f1r110.txt; denotes floor 1, room of floor row 1 in arbitrary center of 10.
	EXAMPLE: b1r308.txt; denotes basement 1, room of floor row 3 that is left of arbitrary center by 2 rooms.

Room Contents Formatting:
	"roomID: ***" A string containing the room name, omitting ".txt".
	"dimensions: # #" The dimensions (row, column) of the room in linear feet scaled back by half (value * 2 = actual distance).
	"object door/stairs/window/obstruction/entity # # ?"
		The two digits represent the position of the object within the room (index of row, index of column).
		The ? is only used for traversable objects (ie: door or stairs) and contains the roomID of the next area.

	EXAMPLE: object door 0 4 f1r109
		a door located at row 0, column 4 in it's room (shifted out to wall when displaying) that leads from its room to
		room f1r109 (see above for room name explanation).
